The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it.

Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha.

And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on.",talisa,333

2013-04-21,Season 3,Episode 4,And Now His Watch Is Ended,"As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjurer's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts.",varys,187

I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special.",varys,130

He burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him. Before long, half the country was against him. Aerys saw traitors everywhere. So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city- beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom. Under houses, stables, taverns. Even beneath the Red Keep itself. Finally, the day of reckoning came. Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident. But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back, promising to defend the city against the rebels. I knew my father better than that. He's never been one to pick the losing side. I told the Mad King as much. I urged him to surrender peacefully. But the king didn't listen to me. He didn't listen to Varys who tried to warn him. But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle, that grey, sunken cunt. 'You can trust the Lannisters,' he said. 'The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown.' So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city. Once again, I came to the king, begging him to surrender. He told me to bring him my father's head. Then he turned to his pyromancer. 'Burn them all,' he said. 'Burn them in their homes. Burn them in their beds.'

Would you have kept your oath then?",jaime lannister,297

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Could I see her first?,edmure,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.,black walder,37

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.,lothar,20
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.,black walder,11

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Listen to me and listen very carefully. You-,brynden,8
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.,edmure,17
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.,brynden,11
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead.",robb stark,16
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing.",edmure,35

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.,robb stark,29
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You recall that heroic engagement?,brynden,5

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.",brienne,25
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason.",roose bolton,21

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?",jaime lannister,16
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.,roose bolton,12
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.,jaime lannister,32
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.,roose bolton,17
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it.",jaime lannister,15
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.,roose bolton,15
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,He'll make time for you.,jaime lannister,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming.",roose bolton,44
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Shall we drink on it?,jaime lannister,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I don't partake.,roose bolton,3
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?,jaime lannister,10
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident.",jaime lannister,11
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Oh, she won't be going with you.",roose bolton,7

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You are charged with abetting treason.,roose bolton,6
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I'm afraid I must insist.,jaime lannister,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.,roose bolton,20
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Impossible.,olenna tyrell,1

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Old?,tywin lannister,1
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely.",olenna tyrell,43
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?",tywin lannister,34
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through.",olenna tyrell,10
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.,tywin lannister,28
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?",olenna tyrell,17
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Of course.,tywin lannister,2
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,And you never-,olenna tyrell,3

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Not once? Not in any way?,olenna tyrell,6
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Never.,tywin lannister,1
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets.",olenna tyrell,22
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.,tywin lannister,9
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"I wouldn't say that. True, we don't tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery, but brothers and sisters- where I come from, that stain would be very difficult to wash out.",olenna tyrell,34
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.,tywin lannister,13
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation.",olenna tyrell,34
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.,tywin lannister,10
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"As an authority on myself, I must disagree.",olenna tyrell,8
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt.",tywin lannister,27
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take.",olenna tyrell,26
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.,tywin lannister,12
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children.",tywin lannister,32
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Oh,olenna tyrell,1
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.,tywin lannister,16
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?,olenna tyrell,11
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?",tywin lannister,29
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,It's a rare enough thing- a man who lives up to his reputation.,olenna tyrell,13

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,That's a wonderful pin.,sansa stark,4
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so",loras,18
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I'm very happy about,sansa stark,4
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Uh, yes. I-I am as well.",loras,7
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I feel like I'm in a dream.,sansa stark,7
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?",loras,53
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.,sansa stark,27
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is.",loras,10
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.,tyrion lannister,10
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,We can have them both killed.,cersei lannister,6
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.,tyrion lannister,31
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.,cersei lannister,11
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,On a boat you built.,tyrion lannister,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.,cersei lannister,17
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.,tyrion lannister,29
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate.",cersei lannister,33
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?,tyrion lannister,46
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot.",tyrion lannister,65
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,What do you want me to say?,cersei lannister,7
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.,tyrion lannister,13
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.,cersei lannister,12
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.,tyrion lannister,8
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands.",cersei lannister,37
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels.",tyrion lannister,22
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere.",cersei lannister,18
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked.",tyrion lannister,6
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Who's going to tell her?,cersei lannister,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Do you think people will like it?,sansa stark,7
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I don't think they will even notice it.,shae,8
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade.",sansa stark,44
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I'm sure he does.,shae,4
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Will they let me invite my family?,sansa stark,7
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,They haven't asked my opinion.,shae,5
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,But do you think they will?,sansa stark,6
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,No.,shae,1

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"I beg your pardon, my lady.",tyrion lannister,6
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding.",sansa stark,15
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa.",tyrion lannister,15
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Of course.,sansa stark,2
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Alone, if I may.",tyrion lannister,4
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Why do you need to speak to her alone?,shae,9
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to.",sansa stark,21
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.,tyrion lannister,28
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"It's all right, really.",sansa stark,4
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,How to begin? It's- this- this- this is awkward.,tyrion lannister,9

2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice.",varys,28
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really, you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want.",petyr baelish,21
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?",varys,23
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience.",petyr baelish,96
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,I did what I did for the good of the realm.,varys,11
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.,petyr baelish,34
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.,varys,20
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.,petyr baelish,8
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.,petyr baelish,17
2013-05-05,Season 3,Episode 6,The Climb,"And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is.",petyr baelish,33

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting? You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?,ygritte,22

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,How do the men holding the banners fight?,ygritte,8

2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.,jon snow,8
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,So what good are they?,ygritte,5
2013-05-12,Season 3,Episode 7,The Bear and the Maiden Fair,They help the men march.,jon snow,5

2014-04-20,Season 4,Episode 3,Breaker of Chains,"No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?",tywin lannister,81

There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it.

She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons.

What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won't back you, not ever.

But that wasn't your lover's way, was it? Now he's burried somewhere. And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever. That must be difficult for you. When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child. I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse. I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms. I never got to have a mother. But Myrcella did.

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack. You're making it difficult. You look a lot better brooding than I do. You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.,tyrion lannister,38
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,I'm a prisoner on this island.,jon snow,6
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,"I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island. You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want.",tyrion lannister,22

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,I do actually.,tyrion lannister,3
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,You didn't before. Grumpkins and snarks you called them. Do you remember? You said it was all nonsense.,jon snow,18

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,I know it's a good question. I'm looking for an answer.,jon snow,11
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,"People's minds aren't made for problems that large. White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister.",tyrion lannister,29
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,I need to help prepare my people for what's coming. I can't help them from here. I'd like to leave.,jon snow,20
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.,tyrion lannister,15
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,"Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes. Don't go south. Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader. And here I am. A northern fool.",jon snow,31
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,"Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us. And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye. Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't. Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now. While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter. She protects people from monsters, just as you do. That's why she came here. And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting. That's not a reasonable thing to ask.",tyrion lannister,125

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,What do you mean?,jon snow,4
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,Maybe you are a northern fool. I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.,tyrion lannister,17

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,"Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them. I'm unsure of the nomenclature.",tyrion lannister,25
2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?,daenerys targaryen,17

2017-07-30,Season 7,Episode 3,The Queen’s Justice,"I would never do that...to you. The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here. All of his advisors would have told him not to come. I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway. You don't have to believe him. Let him mine the Dragonglass. If he's wrong it's worthless. You didn't even know it was here. It's nothing to you. Give him something by giving him nothing. Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally. Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,"I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is.",bronn,76

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.,tyrion lannister,9
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.,euron greyjoy,10

We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face.",tyrion lannister,67

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.,jon snow,60
2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.,cersei lannister,11

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.,cersei lannister,50

2017-08-27,Season 7,Episode 7,The Dragon and the Wolf,I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.,jon snow,38

As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat.
